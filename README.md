# Weather App Documentation

This weather app was created by following a tutorial on YouTube by TapTap. The app allows users to check the weather information for different locations.

## Running the App

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Download the code files from the repository.
2. Open the downloaded code in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
3. Locate and run the `AppLauncher.java` file to start the weather app.

## Integrating API into the App

The process of integrating an API into the app involves the following key steps:

1. **Choosing an API**: Select a suitable weather API provider that offers the necessary weather data for the app.

2. **Setting up API Access**: Obtain an API key or access token from the chosen weather API provider by following their documentation and guidelines.

3. **Making API Requests**: Use HTTP requests (such as GET requests) to communicate with the weather API, passing the necessary parameters and the API key for authentication.

4. **Handling API Responses**: Receive and process the JSON response from the API, extracting the relevant weather data such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts.

5. **Displaying Weather Information**: Populate the app's interface with the retrieved weather data, presenting it in a user-friendly format.

## Learning Experience

During the development of this app, I gained valuable insights into integrating APIs into an app. Key learnings include:

- Selecting a suitable API provider based on the app's requirements.
- Obtaining and using an API key for authentication and access to the weather data.
- Making HTTP requests to fetch data from the API and handling the responses.
- Parsing and extracting relevant information from JSON responses received from the weather API.

This experience has provided a solid foundation for integrating APIs into app development, enhancing my understanding of working with external data sources.
